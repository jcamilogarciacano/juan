Computer Scientist


------------------------
Independently motivated software developer interested in implementing ideas that will facilitate future developers to achieve greater things, and thus, advancing our technological and scientific progress as human civilization. I perceive VR as a tool that can help us explore another "dimension" of possibilities for human experiences and human-computer interactions, that's why I enjoy working on this field, and continuing my research, while surrounded by knowledgeable colleagues and peers.
